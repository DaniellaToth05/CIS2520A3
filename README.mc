## Assignment Overview
What is the assignment about?  

Explain the purpose of the program and what it accomplishes.
    
    This assignment involves implementing two programs to practice using data structures in C. The first program focuses on creating a Binary Expression Tree 
    that parses a fully parenthesized arithmetic expression provided via the command line (e.g., '(((x1+5.12)*(x2-7.68))/x3)'). It builds a tree to represent 
    the expression, supports Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals, and allows users to assign values to variables and evaluate the expression.

    The second program involves implementing a Max-Heap. It reads 200 integers from a text file named f.dat, stores them in a 20x10 2D array, and treats each 
    row as an object with a key and information content. It then builds a max-heap using a downheap algorithm.
